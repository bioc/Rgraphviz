====================
Installing Rgraphviz
====================

Rgraphviz now comes bundles with Graphviz.  This should greatly simplify
installation on all platforms, compared with earlier versions.

While it should not be necessary, we still allow for the use of an external
Graphviz (external to Rgraphviz) at install time(but not on Windows).  This is
indicated by the configure option --with-graphviz.

A direct specification of an external Graphviz at install time would be
  R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-graphviz=/usr/local' Rgraphviz_*.tar.gz 
In this case (with $DIR=/usr/local), the configure script assumes the presence
of 
  $DIR/include/graphviz
  $DIR/lib/graphviz
as is the default when Graphviz is installed.

It is also possible to get Rgraphviz to search for Graphviz, by leaving the
--with-graphviz option empty, as

  R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-graphviz' Rgraphviz_*.tar.gz 

In this case, Rgraphviz will search for Graphviz using the following methods
  (1) First try pkg-config
  (2) See if Graphviz is in its default location of /usr/local

Note
====

The release version of Graphviz 2.28 contains bugs that makes it not work with
Rgraphviz for certain layout options.
